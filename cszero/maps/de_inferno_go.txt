On September 2016, the Separatist get word 
of an undercover government trade deal 
happening in a small city in Italy. 
While the exact location is unknown, two 
locations are filled with dirty gas explosives 
to hi-jack the deal and recover the important 
intel/items. On October 13th of the same year, 
as the faction is set and ready to arm the 
explosives, they are rather greeted with 
SAS Agents verifying if the area is safe and 
secure before the exchange, only improvisation 
is left on their hands. The plan changes to 
blowing up the trade locations with a highly 
explosive C4, compromising the area and cancelling 
the government plans, pushing them to re-set 
the deal to another day. 

Anti-terrorists: Prevent terrorists
to destroy gas explosives.

Terrorists: Blow up commercial places with
a highly explosive C4.

Other Notes: There are 2 bomb sites in this
